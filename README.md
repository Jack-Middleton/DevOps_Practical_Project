<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Brief
The brief for this project was to produce an application consisting of four microservices, which interact with one another to generate objects using some defined logic. This application was produced and maintained using a fully automated CI/CD pipeline. The full tech stack required was as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Kanban Board (or similar) for project tracking</li>
  <li>Git for version control</li>
  <li>Jenkins as a CI server</li>
  <li>Ansible for configuration management</li>
  <li>GCP cloud platform</li>
  <li>Docker as a containerisation tool</li>
  <li>Docker swarm for container orchestration</li>
  <li>NGINX as a reverse proxy</li>
 </ul>
